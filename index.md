Hi, my name's Roberto Unzaga. I'm a recent Computer Engineer graduate working as an Embedded Software Engineer for Lockheed Martin. Feel free to explore and find out more about my [interests](/interests/), my [background](/experience/), [projects](/projects/) I've worked on or review my [resume](/resources/RobertoUnzagaSE.pdf).
### What Makes Me A Cut Above The Rest

I like to work hard and as efficiently as possible. I am very comfortable with people and have given presentations for government customers. I have a government Secret Clearance. I like to take initiative in my learning and am not afraid to ask questions when I don’t understand. I think building relationships and generating loyalty is a very important skill I have and goes very well with honesty; I am a very honest worker and have learned to work hard.
