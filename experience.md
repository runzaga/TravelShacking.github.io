## Work Ethic
I don’t stop until the job is done, and done right. I go for “outstanding” in everything I do. I put in the extra hours to get things right, giving attention to detail and devotion to excellence. My passion shows in how hard I work and it shows in the results I achieve. I truly believe that my successes in life have come from my relentless hard working spirit. 

## Desired Qualities

<ul>
  <li>Creativity is one of my greatest strengths. I have always had a way of thinking outside the box to figure out solutions.</li>
  <li>Willing to take new perspectives to day-to-day work.</li>
  <li>Open to do different things and to do things differently.</li>
  <li>Always striving to create value in new ways.</li>
  <li>Listening to others.</li>
  <li>Supporting and respecting others when they come up with new ideas.</li>
</ul>

## Leadership 
Leadership positions as LDS missionary in Columbus, Ohio, leading as many as 20 missionaries at one time. I was a trainer four different times, a District Leader, and a Zone Leader up until I came home. This experience was very meaningful and insightful in teaching me that people are people. Everyone has problems and hard days and that's alright; I think asking them what's going on is one of the best things you can do.

## Service
I have received an Academic Award from AmeriCorps for over 300 hours of service to elementary kids in Orem. This was the best job I've ever had because I got to tutor kids that were in kindergarten up to 6th grade. I helped them with reading, writing, math, and got to help two Brazilian children and one Russian child learn English. I also helped with their first musical in years and got to play with them at recess. Helping those kids and building relationships will be an experience I will never forget. Serving not only helped the kids but also gave me skills in teaching my own children.

  "Rob always has a great attitude and is very dependable; he has a great work ethic. Rob continually comes up with self-generated ideas to make the process better and he bounces those ideas off his teammates to make sure they are on-target. He is clear and concise, not just in speaking, but in his writing. The Process Model Toolkit project was a collaborative effort and Rob is an excellent team player."
